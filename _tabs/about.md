More than ten years designing and implementing web application systems—building mission-critical banking applications, leading engineering teams, and shipping distributed systems on time. Over that time, I learned that what separates great systems from bloated ones isn't the size of the feature set, but the clarity of the core capability.

That's why I follow a simple product and engineering flywheel—especially in the age of AI: start with one essential capability, prove it end-to-end, then add the next capability only if it amplifies the core. Build a flywheel, not a pile of features.
