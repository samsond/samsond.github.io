### Executive Summary

You're working on a critical project that needs a library, but it's written in a different language. Rewriting it from scratch is time-consuming and error-prone.

Instead, you can create bindings to enable your project to call functions from the library, saving time and maintaining functionality.

To illustrate this, weâ€™ll use a binary search function, which touches on key points like memory layout, safety, CI/CD, and modern tools like Java Panama and Rust.

## Part 1: Introduction to ABI and FFI

### What are ABI and FFI?

The Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines the interface between program modules, ensuring compatibility across different compilers and languages.

The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) allows a program in one language to call functions or use services from another language, relying on the ABI for data and function call compatibility.

We can now explore how these concepts directly impact data alignment and memory layout.

### Data Alignment and Memory Layout

> **Inspired by Eric S. Raymond's article on [Structure Packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/)**

A crucial aspect of ABI is the calling convention, which dictates how registers are used when a function is called. It specifies how input and output parameters are handled, which registers are used for parameters and return values, and which registers can be modified by the function.

Basic C data types have alignment requirements: chars can start on any byte address, but other types like short, int, float, long, and double must start on addresses divisible by their size.

In C, the layout of variables in memory is influenced by data alignment and padding. 

Now, let's see how this translates to Rust. We can use the memoffset crate to determine the offsets of the fields in a Rust struct. By using the #[repr(C)] attribute, we tell the Rust compiler to lay out the struct in memory the same way C would, ensuring the same order, size, and alignment of the fields. Here is an equivalent Rust code:

```rust
use memoffset::offset_of;

#[repr(C)]
struct Foo1 {
    p: *mut u8, // Equivalent to `char *` in C
    c: u8,      // Equivalent to `char` in C
    x: i32,     // Equivalent to `int` in C (4 bytes)
}

fn main() {
    println!("Offset of p: {}", offset_of!(Foo1, p));
    println!("Offset of c: {}", offset_of!(Foo1, c));
    println!("Offset of x: {}", offset_of!(Foo1, x));
}
```
When you run this Rust code, you might get output similar to the following:

```bash
Offset of p: 0
Offset of c: 8
Offset of x: 12
```

This code might result in the following memory layout:

| Address | Variable | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 0-7     | p        | Pointer 8 byte|
| 8       | c        | Character 1 byte|
| 9-11     | Padding  |Added for alignment|
|12-15     | x        | Integer 4 bytes|


The exact offsets may vary depending on the machine you run it on, but this example demonstrates how data alignment is applied in Rust using the offset_of macro. It helps ensure that the memory layout is consistent with the alignment requirements, optimizing access speed and maintaining compatibility with C.



### Java and FFI

Java provides the Foreign Function & Memory API (FFM API) to facilitate interoperability with native code written in another languages like C, C++, and Rust.

From the Java docs: 


> In Java, characters are typically encoded in **UTF-16**, which is the format used by char arrays, which we normally get when we use String and StringBuffer objects.


#### Foreign Function & Memory API (FFM API)

The FFM API is a modern approach introduced as part of the Panama Project. It provides a straightforward and safer way to interact with native code by using Java's type system and memory management features. The FFM API resides in the `java.lang.foreign` package of the `java.base` module.

For more information, refer to the [OpenJDK JEP 424](https://openjdk.org/jeps/424).

### Key Features of the FFM API

1. **Allocate Foreign Memory**: This involves allocating memory that is not part of the Java heap. Classes like `MemorySegment`, `MemoryAddress`, and `SegmentAllocator` facilitate this process.

2. **Manipulate and Access Structured Foreign Memory**: You can define the layout of the foreign memory (such as structs or arrays) using `MemoryLayout` and access individual elements with `VarHandle`.

3. **Control the Allocation and Deallocation of Foreign Memory**: `MemorySession` helps manage the lifecycle of the foreign memory, ensuring it is properly allocated and freed when needed.

4. **Call Foreign Functions**: You can call functions from non-Java code using classes like `Linker`, `FunctionDescriptor`, and `SymbolLookup`.


Circling back to our Rust example, let's see how this translates to Java. We need to use the Foreign Function & Memory API (FFM API). In Java, we must manually specify the padding (reorder the fields) to ensure proper alignment.

Here is the equivalent Java code using the FFM API:

```java
import java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout;
import java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout.PathElement;
import static java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE;
import static java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.JAVA_INT;
import static java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.ADDRESS;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the layout of the struct
        MemoryLayout foo1Layout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
                ADDRESS.withName("p"), // Equivalent to `char *` in C
                JAVA_BYTE.withName("c"), // Equivalent to `char` in C
                MemoryLayout.paddingLayout(3), // Padding to align the next field
                JAVA_INT.withName("x")   // Equivalent to `int` in C (4 bytes)
        );

        // Get the offsets of the fields
        long offsetOfP = foo1Layout.byteOffset(PathElement.groupElement("p"));
        long offsetOfC = foo1Layout.byteOffset(PathElement.groupElement("c"));
        long offsetOfX = foo1Layout.byteOffset(PathElement.groupElement("x"));

        // Print the offsets
        System.out.println("Offset of p: " + offsetOfP);
        System.out.println("Offset of c: " + offsetOfC);
        System.out.println("Offset of x: " + offsetOfX);
    }
}
```
When we run the above code we would get the following similar to Rust example:

```bash
Offset of p: 0
Offset of c: 8
Offset of x: 12
```

### Rust and FFI

Rust provides robust support for FFI, allowing it to interface with other languages like C, C++, and Java. When handling strings in FFI, Rust represents owned strings with the `String` type and borrowed slices of strings with the `str` primitive.

> Rust strings are encoded in **UTF-8**, which is the standard format for string types like String and str.

However, C strings differ from Rust strings, so we need to consider the following as described in Rust FFI docs:

- **Encodings**: Since different languages may use different encodings, it's important to verify which encoding is used in each case.
- **Character Size**: C strings rely on a nul terminator at the end to determine the string's size, whereas in Rust, the size of the string is included explicitly within the string itself. 
- **Internal Nul Characters**: Rust strings can have nul characters in the middle, but C strings typically cannot.
```rust
fn main() {
    let rust_string = "Hello\0world";
    let bytes = rust_string.as_bytes();
    println!("{:?}", bytes); // Will show the nul character inside the string
}
```
output
```bash
[72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100]
```

### Handling Potential Mismatch with CString

To know early on if there are a potential mismatch between C and Rust, we need to use `CString`. For example, let's try the above using `CString`:
```rust
use std::ffi::CString;

fn main() {
    let rust_string = "Hello\0world";

    // Convert Rust string to CString
    // this line will panic due if there is \0 within the string
    let c_string = CString::new(rust_string).expect("CString::new failed");

    // Now you can pass c_string.as_ptr() to a C function.
    let bytes = c_string.as_bytes_with_nul();
    println!("{:?}", bytes);  // Now the internal \0 will not cause issues in C
}
```
As expected we get error at compile time:
```bash
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:13:46:
CString::new failed: NulError(5, [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100])
```

Let's try one more example with the following:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn binary_search(slice: &[i32], target: i32, start_index: usize) -> Option<i64> {
    match slice[start_index..].binary_search(&target) {
        Ok(index) => Some((index + start_index) as i64),
        Err(_) => None,
    }
}
```

When you compile the above you would get the following warning:


```bash
warning: `extern` fn uses type `[i32]`, which is not FFI-safe
  --> src/lib.rs:16:40
   |
16 | pub extern "C" fn binary_search(slice: &[i32], target: i32, start_index: usize) -> Option<i6...
   |                                        ^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
   |
   = help: consider using a raw pointer instead
   = note: slices have no C equivalent
   = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default

warning: `extern` fn uses type `Option<i64>`, which is not FFI-safe
  --> src/lib.rs:16:84
   |
16 | ...et: i32, start_index: usize) -> Option<i64> {
   |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
   |
   = help: consider adding a `#[repr(C)]`, `#[repr(transparent)]`, or integer `#[repr(...)]` attribute to this enum
   = note: enum has no representation hint

warning: `binary_search_lib` (lib) generated 2 warnings
```

Two warnings are printed. The type `&[i32]` is not FFI-safe because slices do not have a direct equivalent in C. 
Instead, use a raw pointer and a length to represent the array.

The warning also indicates that the `Option<i64>` type is not FFI-safe. This means that `Option<i64>` does not 
have a guaranteed representation that is compatible with the C ABI. To make the function FFI-safe, you need 
to use a type that has a well-defined representation in C.


To make the function more compliant with the C ABI, we can use an `enum` to represent the result. and the other one Fix
Replace the slice with a raw pointer and a length.
This way, we avoid returning Rust-specific types like Option, which may not be directly compatible with C.

## Part 2: Practical Example with Rust and Java

In this part, we will demonstrate how to call Rust functions from Java using FFI.

```bash
cargo new binary_search_lib --lib
```

Next, navigate to the src directory and open the lib.rs file. Replace its contents with the following code:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn binary_search(arr: *const i32, len: usize, target: i32) -> i32 {
    let slice = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(arr, len) };
    match slice.binary_search(&target) {
        Ok(index) => index as i32,
        Err(_) => -1,
    }
}
```

Build the Rust library

```bash
cargo build --release
```
### Creating the Java Project
Next, let's create a new Java project using Maven. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
mkdir demo-ffi
gradle init --type java-application --package org.example --project-name demo-ffi
```

Navigate to the src/main/java/org/example directory and open the App.java file. Replace its contents with the following code:
 
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

        String libraryPath = "/path/to/your/libbinary_search_lib.dylib";

        if (libraryPath == null) {
            System.err.println("Library path not set!");
            return;
        }
        
        try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
            // Load the library
            SymbolLookup lib = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup(libraryPath, arena);

            // Find the binary_search function
            MemorySegment binarySearchSymbol = lib.find("binary_search").orElseThrow();

            // Prepare the function descriptor
            FunctionDescriptor descriptor = FunctionDescriptor.of(
                    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,   // return type
                    ValueLayout.ADDRESS,    // arr type
                    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,   // len type
                    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT    // target type
            );

            // Create a MethodHandle for calling the binary_search function
            MethodHandle methodHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(binarySearchSymbol, descriptor);

            // Prepare arguments
            int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11};
            int len = arr.length;
            int target = 7;

            // Allocate off-heap memory and copy the array data
            MemorySegment arrSegment = arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, arr);

            // Call the binary_search function
            int result = (int) methodHandle.invokeExact(arrSegment, len, target);

            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
            System.err.println("Error loading library: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Throwable t) {
            t.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
```

## Part 3: Compatibility Check in CI/CD

Maintaining compatibility is a critical component of CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that new versions of a library donâ€™t introduce breaking changes, which could disrupt client applications. 

In this section, we will demonstrate how to verify ABI compatibility across versions, using tools like `abi-dumper` and `abi-compliance-checker` in a Docker-based environment to ensure continuous integration and deployment stability.

Let's create two versions of a library to demonstrate the tools in action. 

### Version 1: Initial Library Version

```rust

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn binary_search(arr: *const i32, len: usize, target: i32) -> i32 {
    let slice = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(arr, len) };
    match slice.binary_search(&target) {
        Ok(index) => index as i32,
        Err(_) => -1,
    }
}
```
Compile this version and save it as Version 1:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Version 2: Updated Library Version

Now, let's introduce some changes in the library by modifying both the return type and the arguments:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub enum SearchResult {
    Found(i64),
    NotFound,
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn binary_search(array: *const i32, len: usize, target: i32, start_index: usize) -> SearchResult {
    let slice = unsafe { std::slice::from_raw_parts(array, len) };
    match slice[start_index..].binary_search(&target) {
        Ok(index) => SearchResult::Found((index + start_index) as i64),
        Err(_) => SearchResult::NotFound,
    }
}
```
Compile this version and save it as Version 2:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Using abi-dumper and abi-compliance-checker

`abi-dumper` and `abi-compliance-checker` are tools designed to help verify and maintain the compatibility of a libraryâ€™s ABI across different versions.

Let's set up the tools on your development environment using Docker. The Dockerfile for this setup is available in the GitHub repository [abi-ffi-examples/Dockerfile](https://github.com/samsond/abi-ffi-examples/blob/main/Dockerfile). Adapt this file to your library's location and mount point for your setup shown below.

```bash
docker build -t abi-tools -f Dockerfile .

docker run -it --rm --name abi-tools-container \
  -v /path/to/your/project/binary_search_lib/mnt/v1:/mnt/v1 \
  -v /path/to/your/project/binary_search_lib/mnt/v2:/mnt/v2 \
  abi-tools
```
### Checking Compatibility

First, generate an ABI dump for the new version of the library:

```bash
abi-dumper /mnt/v1/libbinary_search_lib.so -o v1_abi.dump -lver 1
abi-dumper /mnt/v2/libbinary_search_lib.so -o v2_abi.dump -lver 2
```

Next, compare the ABI of the new version with the old version using abi-compliance-checker:

```bash
abi-compliance-checker -l binary_search_lib -old v1_abi.dump -new v2_abi.dump
```

Then, we will get a report at compat_reports/binary_search_lib/1_to_2/compat_report.html. 
The report highlights the following changes, making it easy to understand the modifications made 
to the binary_search function.

| Change | 
|--------|
| 1    Parameter `start_index` of type `usize` has been added to the calling stack.  | 
| 2    Type of return value has been changed from `i32` to `struct SearchResult` of different format. | 

By following these steps, you can ensure that your library modifications do not break compatibility, providing a stable and reliable library for your clients.
